\chapter{Formalities}
The engine was the product of the course \textit{Game Engines}, at the \textit{IT University of Copenhagen}, during the fall semester of 2011. % More bla bla?

The engine and documentation is developed and written according the the requirements specified on the course website\footnote{\url{https://blog.itu.dk/MGAE-E2011/project-requirements/}.}.

% The essence of it all.
\chapter{Engine Description}
\label{sec:EngineDescription}
This section will describe the main scope behind the engine, as well as the design rationales behind the choices that were made.

\section{Engine Scope}
\label{sec:EngineScope}
% Does it target a specific genre? What range of games do you have in mind that the engine would be suitable for?
The engine targets the ``Hero \texttt{RTS}\footnote{Real-Time Strategy.}''-genre, more commonly known as ``\texttt{MOBA}\footnote{Multiplayer Online Battle Arena.}''\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_(genre)}}. This includes games like \textit{Heroes of Newerth} and \textit{League of Legends}, both heavy inspired by the \textit{WarCraft III} modification \textit{Defense of the Ancients}\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients}}.

To make our engine achieve the requirements of the genre, it was important to have a clear idea of what expected result should look like. As a good reference, see the example screenshot in \figRef{fig:DRdota2screen}.

\fig[\textwidth]{includes/dota1screen.jpg}{Engine inspiration: Screenshot from \textit{Defense of the Ancients}.}{fig:DRdota2screen}

As can be seen, the basic graphics are fairly simple. There has to be a flat ground-level upon which the player can be controlled around, along with objects he cannot pass. The avatar of the player has to be able to get from \texttt{A} to \texttt{B}, and be able to pathfind around various obstacles. On top of that, there has to be an interactable heads-up display. The camera will do limited movement.

This puts the main focus of the engine on effective handling of mouse events, collision-detection and pathfinding.

% Describe the comparrison to our screenshot. Pretty difficult without a finished screen... but, yeah. I can't think more at this point.

% Here a screen of our own engine should be, for comparing!   
%\fig[\textwidth]{Pictures/enginescreen.jpg}{Screenshot from our Engine, showcading the User Interface.}{fig:DREngineScreen}

\subsection{Engine Structure}
\label{sec:EngineStructure}
We ended out structuring our engine like shown in \figRef{fig:EngineStructure}.

\fig[\textwidth]{flowcharts/diagram.png}{Engine Structure: Diagram showing the structure.}{fig:EngineStructure}

The engine contains each of the blue subsystems (window, settings, events, performance monitor, memory, graphics, physics).

The graphics subsystem contains handling of the HUD, 3D models, materials and a media manager, that handles loading of images and model files.

Some components (the path planner, scene description graph and game objects) are heavily reliant on both the physics and graphics subsystems, and are therefore placed on the intersection between the two systems in the diagram.

\section{Design Rationales}
\label{sec:DesignRationales}
% Were some of the design decisions made after considering alternatives, and do you have rationales for why you made the decisions you did? If so, tell us!
This section covers what decisions was put behind the major parts of the engine: The \textit{graphics-} and \textit{physics systems} and the \textit{path planner}.

\subsection{Graphics}
\label{sec:DesignGraphics}
Displaying graphics on the screen is the most important part of every game engine, and as such some design decisions would have to be made as to how to both import assets as well as how to render them.

As far as importing assets both models and textures would have to be imported, and two options were considered: using a library and wrap it into the engine or write custom importers. They both have their distinct advantages. Using a library will save precious time on having to implement an importer as well as allowing us to import a wide range of file formats. On the other hand creating a custom loader would let us control exactly how the loading occurs and optimize it for performance. Since it was deemed interesting and educational to create a custom loader and since it would allow for better performance, this approach was chosen, and a custom \texttt{.TGA}-texture loader was created and is part of the engine. We started on a custom \texttt{MS3D}-loader, but ended up utilizing a library for all of the model loading. The library of choice was \textit{Assimp}, since it was fairly simple to use and supported a lot of different file formats.

When it comes to method of rendering both dynamic lists and vertex buffers were considered. As the only advantage of using dynamic list were deemed to be ease of use, vertex buffers were chosen for their supposedly better performance. It was quite a struggle to get them working a well integrated into the project. It was first intended to create one vertex buffer per shader, but since we initially had problems implementing the shaders, we decided to drop them for lack of time. Thus, we ended up with one big vertex buffer, since it would theoretically yield the best performance. However, it was soon realized that it was much simpler to work with one vertex buffer per object, and as such this solution was implemented instead, even though the performance might be a bit worse.

\subsection{Physics System}
\label{sec:DesignPhysicsSystem}
The physics system in an \textit{RTS} is an ideal place to cut corners. Since the genre originally emerged as a \textit{2D} game, all game play in \textit{RTS} traditionally are in \textit{2D} even though the graphics are \textit{3D}. Flying units can even be implemented using a \textit{2D} physics system by just adding levels to the physics objects and then checking if objects are on the same level before triggering a collision. Thus, for simplicity it was chosen to implement a \textit{2D} physics system. Furthermore it was chosen to let the physics system control all movement.

\subsection{Path Planner}
\label{sec:DesignPathPlanner}
Pathfinding is an essential component of any \textit{RTS} game, and we also needed it in our engine. This could  be done in a number of different ways (navigation mesh, grid based path finding, using an \texttt{A*} algorithm, breadth first search, etc.). Since the world of \textit{RTS} games are typically fairly open we decided to make the path finding grid based, because of the simplicity. The precision of the pathing can then be altered via the number of grid divisions. However, the precision is reversely proportional with the performance of the path finding. One might argue that for performance it would be better to implement a navigation mesh. However, the simplicity of setting up a grid based path finding is much simpler for the user of the engine than setting up an entire navigation mesh. The user just has set object into the scene and send it to the path planner, that divides it into squares. After these simple steps, the pathfinding is functional. With a navigation mesh the user would have to define each node by defining a convex polygon. This is arguable a lot more cumbersome.

\texttt{A*} was chosen as the actual path finding algorithm, since it allows for implementing different terrain that is harder traversable, and still finding the shortest path in terms of time spent getting there.

\section{Major Features}
\label{sec:MajorFeatures}
% What are the main features your engine supports?
% The things that makes the engine special, the primary forces and so on. There is no further explanations of what this part should contain. Fairly certain this section could be revised in a much better way, with many more details.

To make our game function optimally for the specific game genre, the main features are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item An effective event system, both sendable by input devices and game objects.
	\item A \texttt{HUD} that the mouse can interact with. % Ok, perhaps not.
	\item Pathfinding.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Implementation}
\label{sec:ImplementationOverview}
% Give a high-level explanation of how the engine is structured (perhaps with an architecture diagram). Then, give at least brief explanations of how the major subsystems work, delving into more details for components that are particularly interesting, advanced, or unusual.

This section gives a more detailed description of the various subparts of the engine, based on the list given in Engine Requirements.

\section{Dynamic Elements}
\label{sec:DynamicElements}
% A quick few words on what the Dynamic Element section contains.

\subsection{Physics System}
\label{sec:PhysicsSystem}
% Physics and animation: What makes sense for your engine and why? Decide on a physics/animation split for your engine, considering its target. Do you want forces, manual animations, parametric curves, something else?
% Be able to add/remove objects from the game world dynamically, and update associate data structures.

% TODO

\subsection{Collision Detection}
\label{sec:CollisionDetection}
% Collision detection: have collider surfaces for your objects, with at least basic collision detection. If you need performance (lots of objects), GJK may be best.
% Collision response, if it makes sense for your genre of game: things like objects bouncing off other objects when they collide.

\subsection{Path Planner}
\label{sec:PathPlanner}
The \texttt{PathPlanner} class can be used in conjunction with the Physics System in order to give moving objects in the scene a target destination that they will travel to using the shortest path without traveling into or through other static objects in the scene. Commonly this would be used to give selected units a move-order by using a mouse click event. But before being able to do so, the map must first be initialized. This is shown in \figRef{fig:PathPlanner1}.

\fig[339px]{includes/PathPlanner1.png}{Path Planner, 1: Initializing the map.}{fig:PathPlanner1}

Firstly, the new object is created in the scene, which will be used as the ground and is assigned the ground model, which essentially is a plane width a height and width of one. This is the scaled to a width and height of $40$, or whatever one might want, and positioned so that the lower left corner is in $(0,0)$. Then the width of the map is parsed to to the singleton instance of the \texttt{PathPlanner}.

\fig[420px]{includes/PathPlanner2.jpg}{Path Planner, 2: Creating the two objects.}{fig:PathPlanner2}

Secondly, two other objects are added to the scene. These are examples of the two different types of physic objects that are useable. The first object, which is named player is an example of a moving object. It is initialized just like the ground was, but are then added a physics component of a \texttt{MovingObjectModel}, which's collider is initialized as a circle. Lastly, the component is added to the list of known moving objects in the \texttt{PhysicsSystem}. The exact same thing is done with the box object, but it is just initialized as a \texttt{StaticObjectModel} and with a rectangular collider, and is added to the list of known static objects in the \texttt{PhysicsSystem}. Note that the player object also is parsed to the singleton instance of \texttt{PlayerInteraction}. This is done in order to move it using the \texttt{PathPlanner}, when clicking with the mouse on the ground. In \figRef{fig:PathPlanner2}, it is shown how the these two objects are added.

\fig[299px]{includes/PathPlanner3.png}{Path Planner, 3: Static map path.}{fig:PathPlanner3}

Then the path planning map is set in the end of the \texttt{createGraph()} function. Once this is done, the \texttt{PathPlanner} is ready for use. Note that if any objects are added to or removed from the scene dynamically, then the \texttt{SetStaticPathMap()} has to be called again. This is shown in \figRef{fig:PathPlanner3}.

\section{Resource Management}
\label{sec:ResourceManagement}
% Quick introduction, perhaps?

\subsection{Media Manager}
\label{sec:MediaManager}
% Singleton class (or several) managing global engine state
% Design a resource/dependency-management system, both runtime and offline portion (offline includes things like asset conditioning, and level format).
% Quickest way to get some resources loading: wrap a library like assimp.sourceforge.net
The \textit{Media Manager} is the tool that is to be used in order to import and access media files for use in the game. Currently, it supports importing of \texttt{.TGA}-files as textures and all the common model formats as 3D models, by using \textit{Assimp}\footnote{See \textit{Assimp} documentation for a full list of supported file formats.}. In the future, audio files will be accessed and imported using the media manager as well. As this manager is a singleton, any media imported using it will readily be available anywhere in the code as long you include \texttt{<Managers/MediaManager>}.

In order to import a resource, one must first create either a model or a texture image and place it in the \texttt{Resource} folder. A container must then be created for it in the \texttt{MediaManager} class (\texttt{Texture*} for textures, and \texttt{Model*} for models). Then in the \texttt{MediaManager.StartUp()} function the resource must be loaded and stored in the aforementioned container using the \texttt{LoadTexture()} or \texttt{ImportAssimpModel()} respectively. Hereafter the imported asset can be accessed from the \texttt{MediaManger} singleton from anywhere within the engine. However, as the scene is actually built in \texttt{SceneData.cpp} and the \texttt{createGraph()} function, one would usually access in here in order to assign it to an object in the scene. The memory manager (described in \secRef{sec:MediaManager} is used in the following way:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Firstly two containers, to hold the player's model and its texture, are created. See \figRef{fig:MediaManager1}.
	\item Then the resources are imported in the \texttt{StartUp()} function. See \figRef{fig:MediaManager2}.
	\item And lastly an object is instantiated in the \texttt{createGraph()} function and are assigned the player model that we imported earlier. See \figRef{fig:MediaManager3}.
\end{enumerate}

One might note that the texture is not assigned here. The reason being that it is done automatically when importing the player model as long as the texture is assigned in the model file is called the same as the texture we imported. In this example the name would have to be \texttt{player.tga} or \texttt{PlayerTexture}.

\fig[430px]{includes/MediaManager2.png}{Media Manager, 2: Resources are imported.}{fig:MediaManager2}
\fig[371px]{includes/MediaManager3.png}{Media Manager, 3: Object instantiated.}{fig:MediaManager3}

\subsection{Memory Management}
\label{sec:MemoryManagement}

Our engine implements a stack based single frame allocator. This is useful for variables, that are created in every frame.

At the beginning of each frame the allocator deletes all allocated memory and therefore each frame starts with a clean slate. It is not possible to deallocate specific elements from the frame allocator. Due to it being stack based, it is only possible to roll back the stack to a specified marked point. This deallocates all memory that was allocated after the marker was retrieved.

We have also implemented a basic smart pointer structure, that can be used, if a general heap allocator wants to be implemented at a later point. The allocator should return a smart pointer (containing the real address to the allocated memory) instead of a normal pointer. This will allow the heap allocator to move the allocated memory blocks around, without breaking the users memory access, if the smart pointers internal pointer is updated with the new memory location. This is necessary because a general memory allocator like a heap allocator can become fragmented. It is then necessary to clean up once in a while, so the allocator does not waste too much space on uninitialized memory blocks that are too small to actually contain anything. If the defragmentation method splits up the defragmentation over several frames, the memory can stay more or less defragmented while preventing excessive CPU usage.

\subsection{Settings Manager}
\label{sec:SettingsManager}
% I think this is a good spot to describe the Settings Manager, as it doesn't really seem to fit in anywhere else.
As every game needs variable settings and options, which should be easy to customize. We decided to keep the data in an external \texttt{XML}-file, so that it is easily changeable outside the game. This opens up for the possibility of having a light-weight external tool.

Inside the engine, the \texttt{XML}-file is loaded upon startup and stored as a DOM\footnote{The ``Document Object Model''-standard.} tree, which is easily traversable and logically structured. In the same way, the tree can be exported back to the \texttt{XML}-file at any given time, and will also do so upon shutting down the engine.

\section{Rendering}
\label{sec:Rendering}
% Object-oriented, scenegraph-based rendering, that recursively renders objects in the scene.
% Use a method of speeding up rendering by retaining data on the GPU. For now display lists are okay, but vertex buffers are better (and will be useful later).
% Material properties on objects
% Textures on objects
% Shaders: Optional. A user-programmable shader API for your engine could be a nice enhancement. But, everyone should understand how shaders work, even if your engine doesnï¿½t use them.

\subsection{Camera}
\label{sec:Camera}
% A camera component should be present.

Our camera has a location, a position it is pointed at and an up vector.

TODO.

\subsection{Lighting Manager}
\label{sec:LightingManager}
% Lighting manager (or data structures) storing information on lights in the scene

\section{Game Loop}
\label{sec:GameLoop}
% Support framerate-independent game-world updates (e.g. using deltaT timings).
% Implement an event system (may be useful to split into several event systems, e.g. an InputManager handling all input events).
The game loop catches and handles all input and game events first. Then, the physics system is run with the elapsed time since the last update. When the 'model' of the world is updated, everything is drawn. In the end, we measure our performance and frame memory usage. A visual representation can be seen in \figRef{fig:GameLoop}.

\fig[128px]{flowcharts/loop.png}{Game Loop: Flowchart showing the main game loop.}{fig:GameLoop}

\subsection{Event System}
\label{sec:EventSystem}
% General thoughts about the Event System.
The general event system is structured with event listeners and event managers as described in Game Coding Complete \footnote{Game Coding Complete, Mike McShaffry et al. 3rd ed. Chapter 10.}. When a system like the physics system wants to update a moving object it can send an event to the event handler. All subsystems who want information about that event then gets notified. That keeps the relationship between the subsystems to a minimum, since they only have to keep track of themselves and the event manager.

\section{Input}
\label{sec:Input}
% Handle keyboard input, with at least a few options. For example: event-based input that queues multiple keypresses, and polling-based input that does something while the key is held down.
% Handle mouse (or joystick/controller) input, with the option for nonlinear mapping
% Connect input to scene in a basic way, e.g. wasd moves an object, mouse moves camera.
The engine uses the SDL API to register keyboard and mouse input using their built in event types. When the engine is started a loop runs using the \texttt{SDL\_PollEvent} method. A switch-case calls the appropriate handlers when SDL events is registered.

\subsection{Mouse}
\label{sec:Mouse}
%Fairly extensive section, as there is surely lots to be written in regards to how it works (ie, from mouse-coordinates on the screen to coordinates on the HUD/Worldspace, Events, and... whatever more there is.
When a mouse-press is registered window coordinates are translated into \textit{OpenGL} world space coordinates and an event for pathfinding and movement of the player is triggered.

The mapping from screen coordinates to world coordinates happen via an inverse projection matrix.

\subsection{Keyboard}
\label{sec:Keyboard}
% Again, event system, what the uses are... erh, yeah. Probably not that much to write here, really.
When the keyboard are pressed, an event with the appropriate key is created which other subsystems can listen for. The engine currently only listens for escape key and exits when pressed.

\section{Advanced feature: Performance Logging}
\label{sec:PerformanceLogging}
%Pick either one area of the engine to add advanced functionality to, or at least one optional feature to add. For example: a user-programmable shader interface, procedural terrain, advanced physics, an audio subsystem, etc.

The performance logger enables the user of the engine to find out which parts of the code
are taking the most time. The performance logger allows the user to measure time and save the
measurements in distinct, named, lists. I.e., the physics step could be measured and saved in a list named physics. The lists are saved to a CSV file when they are full. We specified that the lists should contain at most 1000 elements, which will correspond to 1000 frames, about 1-2 seconds on our development machines, if a certain section is logged every frame.

We decided against doing the graphing of logged entries ourselves, as an offline component like Microsoft Excel excels at this.

%\chapter{Examples}
%\label{sec:Examples}
% Give some examples illustrating interesting features of your engine and how theyï¿½d be used. Depending on the features, these can take the form of screenshots, code snippets, flow charts, and/or prose explanation.

% Giving examples is one of the requirements of the documentation. It could either be done throughout the document, or simply be here in a chapter for itself. Most likely a better idea, to keep it from the more in-depth technical facts.

% It is probably easier simply omitting this section, and describing it when going over the various parts instead. Look at that later.

\chapter{Post Mortem}
\label{sec:PostMortem}
% Might be a good idea with a minor wrap-up at the end. A better name could be used for this section - but a fitting alternative is eluding me at this point.

\end{document}
